Write a function that takes user input e.g. "123321" and returns the value.

The user input may have a prefix that needs to be dealt with accordingly.

Any non-legitimate symbols such as spaces, new lines or EOF terminates the value.

The function returns the value up until the non-legitimate symbol.

If the value is equal to or greater than the max possible value, you return 
the max possible value. (65535)

If the value starts with a non-legitimate symbol, you return -0.
